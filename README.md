- 👋 Hi, I’m @jean-morieult
- 👀 I’m interested in developing AI deep learning models to become predictive in design tasks by observing my way of doing things, to a degree that one day i can simply design by voice prompt alone  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python coding, p5.js web, GPT plugins, Unreal Engine, Twinmotion, Nvidia Omniverse, Adobe creative suite with AI
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating my AI model that adapts and learns to operate all hardware i can connect to an internal network and also be my designer by promt, and review. As well as my assistant/coleague that can answer emails and phonecalls on my behalf and interact as well as answer in a humanlike way<!---
